# SFOS-MTG-Life-Counter
## SailfishOS Magic the Gathering life counter app

I realize the code is probably awful, but it kinda works so there's that. 
I tried to comment some things, don't expect the comments to make sense. Hopefully they'll make sense to me at least.

## Bugs:
 - Don't change life values too quickly. I have no idea how the history log part works (everything is cobbled together from StackOverflow answers ðŸ™ƒ). 
  - As I upload this, I just realized there's a settings entry in the pulley menu. That doesn't do anything yet, or at least nothing useful. Maybe I'll implement something useful in the future, but I honestly cannot think of anything that could be set...
 - Names are not reflected on the cover, and moving the cursor in a text field is weirdly broken. That I would like to fix, but I am not sure how yet....
